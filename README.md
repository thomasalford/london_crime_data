# london_crime_data
First attempted, self-assigned data visualisation project (python, pandas, latitude/longitude, plotting)

## Aim
The aim of this project is to plot some sort of density map onto an actual map of London (or any given area within reasonable size limits of the UK) some visualisation of the rates of violent crime.

#### Preliminary work
The UK Police website provides a free-to-use API to request data on crime by a number of different API calls. Including the option to request data within specified pairs of latitude and longitude points.

#### For example `https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/all-crime?poly=52.268,0.543:52.794,0.238:52.130,0.478&date=2018-01` for more information on the API [click here](https://data.police.uk/docs/)
